# code-refactoring

Author: Takara Truong

This project builds a main company page for the company Horiseon.
The purpose of this project were to build skills such as setting up and deploying a webpage, basic styling, and semantic structuring to keep a clean and readable code.  It incorporates using skills such as basic html setup and css styling to create a informative webpage that is also visibly appealing. The website was originally full of redundant code and the code structure was not semantic. Going through the website's code, I removed redundant css classes, added indentation, added alt attributes to images, renamed div tags to be more descriptive, and added comments to make the code more understandable.

In the future, I hope to apply more responsive elements such as flexbox and @media to make future websites more accessible to mobile users and more responsive as well.
